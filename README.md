# Job Board App üöÄ

This project allows users to browse job listings fetched from the Arbeitnow API and submit applications via Webhook.site.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Job Listing:** Displays jobs fetched from the Arbeitnow API.
* **Job Details:** View detailed information for each job.
* **Application Submission:** Apply for jobs using a form that submits data to Webhook.site.
* **Responsive Design:** User interface built with Shadcn UI for a seamless experience across devices.
* **Type Safety:** Fully typed codebase with TypeScript.
* **Efficient Data Fetching:** Utilizes TanStack Query for robust data fetching, caching, and state synchronization.
* **Client-Side State Management:** Leverages Jotai for minimalistic and flexible global state management.
* **Form Handling:** Robust form validation and management using React Hook Form and Zod.

## üìÅ Project Structure & Naming Conventions

The project follows a feature-first approach combined with a clear separation of concerns. Key directories include:

* `app/`: Contains all routes, layouts, and pages for the Next.js App Router.
* `atoms/`: Holds Jotai atoms for global state management.
* `providers/`: Houses context providers, including TanStack Query client and any other global providers.
* `components/ui/`: Contains reusable UI components, primarily from Shadcn UI or custom-built atomic components.
* `components/job/`: Contains components specifically related to job listings, job details, and application forms.
* `lib/`: Utility functions and helpers.

**Naming Convention:**
This project adheres to **kebab-case** for file and folder names, inspired by best practices for maintainable and scalable React applications (similar to conventions found in repositories like "bullet-proof-react").

Example:
* `components/job/job-card.tsx`
* `app/(main)/job-listings/page.tsx`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Known Limitations

* **Client-Side Operations:**
    * **Search and Filtering:** The Arbeitnow API used for job listings does not natively support search or filtering parameters. Therefore, these functionalities have been implemented **client-side using Jotai** to manage the state of the filtered list.
    * **Fetching Job by Slug/ID:** Similarly, fetching a single job by its slug or ID directly from the API is not supported. This logic is handled on the client-side by finding the job in the list fetched and stored in Jotai.
    * **State Persistence on Refresh:** Consequently, if a user refreshes a job details page, the client-side Jotai state will be cleared. If the job list isn't re-fetched and the specific job isn't present in the initial client-side data, this could lead to a a 404 page.
* **Job Description Rendering:**
    * Job descriptions are fetched from the API and rendered **as-is**. Due to time constraints, rich text rendering (e.g., parsing Markdown) has **not** been implemented. This means descriptions might appear as raw HTML or plain text depending on the API response.
